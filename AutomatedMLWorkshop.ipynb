If not, here are a few tips\n\n>* Select the Kernet Python 3.6\n>* Jupyter has 'cells'. When you click on anywhere in the notebook, the cell containing the pointer gets selected.\n>* To run or execute the code in the cell - on the top menu select Cell->Run Cells. Alternatively you can use 'Shift+Enter' keys.\n>* To Edit cell - Double click the cell\n>* When you run a cell, the pointer pointing just outside on the left side of the cell will change from [] to [*] (inserts * in the square brackets). When the cell finished executing the '*' changes to a number.\n>* If the notebook or cell hangs, select from the top menu Kernel->Restart & Clear output for the entire notebook or Kernel->Interrupt for just that cell. Restart will take a few seconds and you would need to reexecute all the cells.\n>* In Jupyter you do not need to execute in sequence. You can go back to a previous cell that was already executed and execute again. As long as there are no dependencies that messes up the code in that particular cell, you will be fine."

      "source": "# Scenario:\n\nThis scenario focuses on energy demand forecasting where the __goal is to predict the future load on an energy grid__. It is a critical business operation for companies in the energy sector as operators need to maintain the fine balance between the energy consumed on a grid and the energy supplied to it. Too much power supplied to the grid can result in waste of energy or technical faults. However, if too little power is supplied it can lead to blackouts, leaving customers without power. Typically, grid operators can take short-term decisions to manage energy supply to the grid and keep the load in balance. An accurate short-term forecast of energy demand is therefore essential for the operator to make these decisions with confidence.\n\nThis scenario details the construction of a machine learning energy demand forecasting solution. The solution is trained on a public dataset from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which operates the power grid for New York State. The dataset includes hourly power demand data for New York City over a period of five years. An additional dataset containing hourly weather conditions in New York City over the same time period was taken from darksky.net.\n\nIn this notebook you will perform\n\n1. Basic Setup: You would need to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace to start with. You can do that in Azure Portal or through SDK. The workspace can be shared with your team mates to collaborate on the scripts. You would create an workspace one time and run multiple experiments and build many models.\n\n2. Prepare the data: Prepare the data for training.\n\n3. Train an automated ML model: We will use Azure Notebooks to train models with automated ML generated pipeline parameters.\n\n4. Explore the results Inspect various way to get all the models built, Many different model metrics\n\n5. Testing the fitted model with some test data\n\n6. Register the model for deployment and get ready for deployment into Azure Machine Learning model management and deployment hosting"

You can see what resource groups to which you have access, or create a new one in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  If you don't have a resource group, the create workspace command will create one for you using the name you provide.\n\nThe region to host your workspace will be used if you are creating a new workspace.  You do not need to specify this if you are using an existing workspace. You can find the list of supported regions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=machine-learning-service).  You should pick a region that is close to your location or that contains your data.\n\nThe name for your workspace is unique within the subscription and should be descriptive enough to discern among other AML Workspaces.  The subscription may be used only by you, or it may be used by your department or your entire enterprise, so choose a name that makes sense for your situation.\n\nThe following cell allows you to specify your workspace parameters.  This cell uses the python method `os.getenv` to read values from environment variables which is useful for automation.  If no environment variable exists, the parameters will be set to the specified default values.  \n\nIf you ran the Azure Machine Learning [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/quickstart-get-started) in Azure Notebooks, you already have a configured workspace!  You can go to your Azure Machine Learning Getting Started library, view *config.json* file, and copy-paste the values for subscription ID, resource group and workspace name below.\n\nReplace the default values in the cell below with your workspace parameters"
